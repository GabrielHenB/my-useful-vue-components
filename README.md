# my-useful-vue-components

This repository consists of a few Vue 3 Components I coded for my personal use. Tried to write them as decoupled from each other as possible.

The idea was that I'd be able to simply grab them and re-use later on or study how I did them and re-apply the same logic. Its also for practice and testing purposes.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Project Setup

First this repository should be cloned. Then you'd need to run NPM commands as follows.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

This opens an Vite development 'server' which is capable of hot-reloading. Useful.

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Contributions

Mostly done by myself, a few hints obtained from online sources and some components I jointly developed with friends.
